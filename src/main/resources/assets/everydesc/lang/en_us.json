They're capable of sending any command, at any time!

As the name suggests, they represent a 'void,' and when included in a structure, effectively tells the block, when generating, to leave this block unchanged.

To obtain, type in /give @p structure_void.",
  "everydesc.minecraft:structure_block": "§nStructure Block §r\n\nStructure blocks are rather self-explanatory: they're blocks that place down and can save a structure when used!

  "everydesc.minecraft:petrified_oak_slab": "§nPetrified Oak Slab §r\n\nA remnant of a long lost version of minecraft, the petrified oak slab is basically a totally normal oak slab! Just it acts like a stone slab. This is because, in the past, the petrified oak slab actually shared the same exact block ID, back when they were all documented via numbers rather than the modern name system. Cool!",

  "everydesc.minecraft:vines": "§nVines §r\n\nVines are nature’s ladder! They can be found primarily in swamps and jungles, and climbed to the treetops! They can also be harvested with Shears for decoration, but cannot be bonemealed, making it a slow block to grow.",
  "everydesc.minecraft:barrel": "§nBarrel §r\n\nBarrels are one of the most compact storage blocks! Like chests, one stores 27 item slots, however they do not combine to make double chests, and they also take up a full block. This makes them slightly less laggy in some cases, more compact and versatile, and a good decoration option! They're also the workstation of the Fisherman villager, which buys and sells anything ocean related from boats, fish, to campfires (for some reason?) and fishing rods. They can be rather annoying if you use barrels for storage and have villagers nearby, unfortunately.",
  "everydesc.minecraft:blast_furnace": "§nBlast Furnace §r\n\nBlast Furnaces are the ultimate ore-smelters, quickly melting down iron, gold, ancient debris, and even silk-touched ores.

  "everydesc.minecraft:sugar_cane": "§nSugar Cane §r\n\nSugar Cane is a valuable crop for food and utility alike! It can grow on sand, grass, and moss if next to water, and if you have excess, can be composted into bonemeal (Despite being immune to the stuff).",

Chorus Flowers are grown on End Stone, are immune to Bonemeal, and can branch out to make more flowers.",
  "everydesc.minecraft:lightning_rod": "§nLightning Rod§r\n\nThis handy little copper contraption is a must-have if you want to protect your base during a storm! It can also generate a little bit of power when it's struck. Be careful, though: the blocks around a lightning rod can still catch fire when lightning does strike.",
  "everydesc.minecraft:glowstone":"§nGlowstone §r\n\n forms in crystalline clusters on the ceiling of the Nether, where it provides light. Though it shatters into dust if not mined with Silk Touch, this §6Glowstone Dust§r is used by Witches to amplify the effects of their potions. The block itself makes a pleasant light source that fuels the §5Respawn Anchor's§r respawning powers.",
  "everydesc.minecraft:nether_portal": "§nNether Portal §r\n\nThe rift between dimensions given form, stepping through will take you to the other side... Regardless of whichever side you're entering from, whatever awaits there likely won't be friendly. Be prepared for the worst!",

  "everydesc.minecraft:composter": "§nComposter §r\n\nThe Composter is an extremely good block for anyone with a large surplus of plantlife! By placing in almost any plant-like item, whether it be saplings, leaves, seeds, crops, or the like, it'll have a chance to fill the Composter with another layer. Once full, it'll make bonemeal! It's also the workstation for the Farmer, who buys crops, and sells food.",
  "everydesc.minecraft:fletching_table": "§nFletching Table §r\n\nThe Fletching Table is a rather useless block (as of now) excluding being a villager workstation for, well, the Fletcher!

  "everydesc.minecraft:bell": "§nBell §r\n\nThe centerpiece of all villages! During midday, villagers will gather near Bells and make any 'decisions' they need to do, such as creating an iron golem, more villagers (wink wink) and sharing food. It is also able to be rung during a raid in order to see any leftover raiders. Finally, it causes any wandering traders that happen to spawn to go towards it, with decently higher rates. Warning: it's quite annoying!",
  "everydesc.minecraft:target": "§nTarget §r\n\nThe Target block is a simple block used in redstone, notably for sending redstone signals when hit with a projectile. (Stronger the closer to the center it is! Try to aim a bullseye from far away!) The Target also has the unique property of being opaque, without being a mechanism (like pistons) it still directs redstone to it. Go off, redstone engineers!",
  "everydesc.minecraft:soul_sand": "§nSoul Sand §r\n\nSoul Sand takes the appearance of disturbing, eerie, clawing faces, grabbing at your ankles and slowing you down massively. Perfect for growing the rare Nether Wart! Also, if your boots are enchanted with Soul Speed, the block speeds you up, rather than slows you down!",
  "everydesc.minecraft:soul_soil": "§nSoul Soil §r\n\nSoul Soil is very similar to Soul Sand, with the same exact coloration. However, unlike Soul Sand, Soul Soil doesn't slow you down when walked on normally and also lacks the disturbing faces. It also, notably, lacks the ability to grow Nether Wart. You are still massively sped up when using Soul Speed Boots, though.",
  "everydesc.minecraft:soul_fire": "§nSoul Fire §r\n\nUnlike the blazing red flames of the rest of the Nether, Soul Fire glows an eerie blue, lighting up the Soul Sand Valleys the flames are found in.

  "everydesc.minecraft:coal_block": "§nBlock of Coal§r\n\nWith ten times the endurance of a single piece of coal, a block of the stuff only takes nine to craft! That'll yield you 80 items worth of cooked goods.

  "everydesc.minecraft:flint_and_steel": "§nFlint and Steel §r\n\nSparking this item together is a handy way to create fire whenever you need it. That same heat is known to catalyze Obsidian frames into dimensional rifts... It can also be used to burn animals alive, if that's more your style.",

  "everydesc.minecraft:coarse_dirt": "§nCoarse Dirt §r\n\nCoarse dirt may seem rather useless at first, however don't simply brush it off as another building block! Crafted by combining dirt and gravel, Coarse Dirt is able to effectively turn gravel into dirt, as by hoeing Coarse Dirt removes the 'coarse' part. Shoveling and turning them into paths does this too. Coarse Dirt also doesn't have grass grow on it, making it decent for if you don't want grass to grow in certain areas, such as the sides of paths.",
  "everydesc.minecraft:podzol": "§nPodzol §r\n\nPodzol is an excellent terraforming block, being very useful for adding some texture and depth to more forested areas, and is found naturally underneath massive spruce trees.
